# Ambulance Detection System

A project developed for the Pragyan competition to identify emergency vehicles in real-time using audio and video analysis, helping to prioritize their route through traffic.

## Overview

This system provides a proof-of-concept for intelligent traffic management by detecting ambulance sirens and vehicles. It uses a combination of audio and video processing to achieve this:

*   **Audio Detection**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifies sound clips to distinguish between ambulance sirens, firetruck sirens, and general traffic noise. The audio is converted into a spectrogram image, which is then fed into the model.
*   **Video Detection**: A YOLOv3-tiny model is used for real-time object detection to visually identify ambulances in a video feed.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main components:

*   `audio_model/`: Contains the complete pipeline for audio-based siren detection.
    *   `train.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook to train the audio classification model.
    *   `mic.py`: A script to run live inference using a microphone.
    *   `model/`: Contains the pre-trained TensorFlow model.
    *   `dataset/`: Holds the audio dataset for training.
*   `video_model/`: Contains the pipeline for video-based vehicle detection.
    *   `yolo_object_detection.py`: A script for running inference on video files or a live camera feed.
    *   `yolov3-tiny_training_final.weights`: Pre-trained weights for the YOLO model.
*   `videos/`: Contains sample videos for testing the video detection model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   Pip

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone Ambulance_detection
    cd Ambulance_detection
    ```

2.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    The audio model has its own set of dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r audio_model/requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: The video model dependencies like OpenCV need to be installed separately if not already present.)*

### How to Run

#### Audio Detection (from Microphone)

To start detecting sounds from your microphone in real-time:

```bash
python audio_model/mic.py
```

The script will listen for sounds and classify them as "Ambulance," "Firetruck," or "Traffic."

#### Video Detection

To run object detection on a video file:

```bash
python video_model/yolo_object_detection.py --video videos/your_video.mp4
```

## Dataset

The audio classification model was trained on the [Emergency Vehicle Siren Sounds](https://www.kaggle.com/vishnu0399/emergency-vehicle-siren-sounds) dataset from Kaggle.
